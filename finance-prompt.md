Dividend growth suggestions:
- Base temporale di 10/20 anni rischio medio
tale aumento deve essere superiore al valore dell’inflazione
- investire su titoli azionari noti per generare un dividendo costantemente in aumento da diversi anni. Il secondo punto è quello di concentrare i propri investimenti su titoli che aumentano ogni anno il loro dividendo e ad un tasso superiore a quello inflattivo. I titoli DA aumentano regolarmente il loro dividendo da almeno 25 anni ad un tasso mediamente compreso tra il 7% e il 15% annuo, ovvero tra i 5 e i 13 punti percentuali superiori al tasso inflattivo
titoli azionari che aumentano annualmente e da almeno 25 anni il loro dividendo sono detti Dividend Aristocrats (DA), ed a questo gruppo di titoli elitari fanno parte aziende come Coca-Cola, McDonald, Philip Morris, IBM, Procter&Gamble. 
- Il primo punto è quello di contribuire regolarmente al portafoglio.
 aziende con un dividendo di almeno il 2.5-3%
• che hanno aumentato il loro dividendo per almeno 25 anni 
• con un P/E (Price/earnings) inferiore a  20 volte gli utili .
• con un PR (Payout Ratio) non superiore a 60 
Di conseguenza , al fine di avere un flusso di reddito difendibile , è necessario possedere almeno 30 titoli diversi ed appartenenti a diverse categorie settoriali (industriali, bancari, consumer staples, farmaceutici, retail, ecc.)
- Il quinto punto è quello di reinvestire i dividendi nei titoli del proprio portafoglio allo scopo di sfruttare l’effetto “compunding”. 
- In ultimo, un titolo DGI non si vende mai, proprio perché lo scopo è quello di percepire dividendi sempre crescenti ogni anno. Tranne in una occasione: il taglio del dividendo
- ones with the cheapest valuations. 
- DO NOT MODIFY MY THIRD PILLAR ALLOCATIONS
