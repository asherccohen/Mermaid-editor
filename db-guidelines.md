Im building a wealth management app, the main entities are: portfolios, orders, positions, investments, strategies.

Executed SQL
See diagram
The tables for your wealth management app have been successfully created. Here's a brief overview of each:

Portfolios: Stores information about different portfolios, including their name and timestamps for creation and updates.

Investments: Linked to portfolios, this table holds details about each investment, such as the name and amount invested.

Strategies: Contains strategy details, including a description and timestamps.

Positions: Represents positions within investments, linked to strategies, and includes the quantity held.

Orders: Associated with positions, this table records order details, including type, quantity, and price.

These tables are interconnected to reflect the relationships between portfolios, investments, strategies, positions, and orders.

Is this the best practice? I instead kept portfolios very light, and linked positions to investmentid and portfolioid
Your approach of keeping the portfolios table light and linking positions to both investment_id and portfolio_id can be a valid design choice, depending on your application's specific requirements. Here are some considerations:

Portfolios Table: Keeping it light is beneficial if portfolios primarily serve as a categorization or grouping mechanism without needing extensive data. This can simplify the database schema and improve performance for certain queries.

Linking Positions to Investment and Portfolio:

Pros:
Directly linking positions to both investment_id and portfolio_id can simplify queries that need to access both investment and portfolio data.
It can reduce the need for complex joins, especially if positions frequently need to be queried in the context of both investments and portfolios.
Cons:
It introduces redundancy, as the portfolio_id is already indirectly linked through the investment_id. This can lead to potential data inconsistency if not managed properly.
It may complicate data integrity constraints, requiring additional checks to ensure that the portfolio_id in positions matches the portfolio_id in investments.
Best Practices:

Ensure data integrity by using foreign key constraints and possibly triggers to maintain consistency.
Consider the most common queries and operations your application will perform. Optimize the schema to make these operations efficient.
Regularly review and refactor the schema as the application evolves to ensure it continues to meet performance and scalability needs.
Ultimately, the best practice depends on your specific use case, including the expected data volume, query patterns, and application logic.

Sounds good. What about how strategies are linked? A strategy has allocations and is created to then help logic to suggest trades
Linking strategies effectively in your wealth management app involves considering how strategies interact with other entities like portfolios, investments, and positions. Here's a refined approach:

Strategies Table:

This table should store basic information about each strategy, such as its name, description, and any metadata that describes its purpose or logic.
Allocations:

You can create an allocations table that links strategies to specific investments or asset classes. This table would define how much of a portfolio or investment should be allocated according to a particular strategy.
Allocations Table Structure:
id: Primary key
strategy_id: Foreign key referencing the strategies table
investment_id or asset_class_id: Foreign key referencing the investments table or a separate asset classes table
allocation_percentage: Numeric value indicating the percentage of the portfolio or investment allocated to this strategy
created_at and updated_at: Timestamps
Trade Suggestions:

To facilitate trade suggestions, you might implement a logic layer in your application that uses the strategy and allocation data to generate trade recommendations.
This logic can consider current market conditions, portfolio performance, and strategy rules to suggest trades that align with the strategy's goals.
Linking Strategies to Positions:

Positions can be linked to strategies to indicate which strategy is being applied to a particular position. This can help in tracking performance and making adjustments based on strategy outcomes.
You might already have this link if positions reference strategy_id, as in your initial setup.
Best Practices:

Ensure that the strategy logic is flexible and can be updated as market conditions change.
Use indices on foreign keys and frequently queried columns to optimize performance.
Regularly review and test the strategy logic to ensure it aligns with investment goals and risk tolerance.
By structuring your database and application logic in this way, you can create a robust system for managing strategies, allocations, and trade suggestions.
